## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### Hierarchical PID Structure
```
RAiD (Base):                  https://raid.org/10.1234/research-project-2025
├── AIDE Disclosure 1:        https://raid.org/10.1234/research-project-2025/aide.001
├── AIDE Disclosure 2:        https://raid.org/10.1234/research-project-2025/aide.002
└── Related Components:       https://raid.org/10.1234/research-project-2025/model.xyz
```

### Live API Testing (With Credentials)
- Research activity creation with RAiD API
- AIDE disclosure registration as hierarchical components
- Multi-step workflow automation
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## 🌟 Benefits Demonstrated

### 1. PID Explosion Prevention
- **Before**: Each AI usage → separate PID (100 usages = 100 PIDs)
- **After**: Research project → 1 RAiD + hierarchical components (100 usages = 1 base + 100 components)

### 2. Research Context Integration
- Every AIDE disclosure linked to specific research project (RAiD)
- Project-level AI usage tracking and compliance
- Automated grant and funding reporting

### 3. Global Standards Compliance
- ISO 23527 standard through RAiD integration
- International compatibility and recognition
- Established governance and infrastructure

### 4. Enhanced Provenance
- Complete bidirectional traceability from AI outputs back to research projects
- Machine-readable change logs for compliance
- Cryptographic verification support

## 🛠 Production Readiness

### Infrastructure Requirements
- ✅ Serverless-compatible (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- ✅ Container deployment ready (Docker)
- ✅ Environment configuration support
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Security and Compliance
- ✅ API key management and secure authentication
- ✅ Data sovereignty considerations
- ✅ Audit trail and immutable record support
- ✅ Access control and permissions framework

### Scalability Features
- ✅ Batch processing for large-scale workflows
- ✅ Asynchronous operations and timeout handling
- ✅ Retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
- ✅ Monitoring and analytics capabilities

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Production API Setup
- Obtain production RAiD API credentials
